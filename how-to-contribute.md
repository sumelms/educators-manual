# How to contribute

This manual was developed in a collaborative way, and it is open for new contributions. However,  to make it possible to maintain the quality of the publications that are available here, we created this brief guide based on the well-established guidelines provided by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contributing_to_Wikipedia).

## **Protocols and conventions‌**

### **Code of conduct‌**

Sumé is a community dedicated to provide an inclusive and safe experience for everyone. For this reason, we adopted a [code of conduc](https://sumelms.com/docs/conduct)t that values the strength of our diversity. Below, some golden rules that can be very useful:‌

* Be friendly and patient;
* Be receptive and use inclusive language;
* Be attentive
* Be respectful;
* Be careful with the words you use;
* Be constructive;**‌**

### **Discussion and consensus‌**

As this is a collaborative work, there will be times when parts will disagree on a particular subject or its structure.‌

In this case, contributors must always act respectfully to each other and work together, avoiding any behavior seen as unacceptable, offensive,  biased or dishonest. And, with that, in common agreement, to find the best solution to the point they disagree. ‌

If an agreement is not possible between the parties, the moderation will work to solve the issue.**‌**

### **Moderation‌**

The moderators are responsible for approving, removing, editing or changing any material contained in this manual without prior notice to the contributor,  such as interventions in discussions to mediate a solution to possible conflicts and disagreements.‌

However, the role of the moderator is not absolute, and their actions can be reviewed and taken to a council, which is formed by other moderators, and who will be able to review these actions.

## **External resources‌**

The use of external resources, such as images, videos and audio is not prohibited, however it is not recommended. It is recommended to use external resources only for the following situations: ‌

* Videos \(YouTube\)
* Audio \(SoundCloud\)
* Documents \(Google Drive, OneDrive\)‌

For images,  it is preferable that they are always hosted within the space provided in this manual.**‌**

### **References‌**

To refer to author or their work, the following notation is used:

"The reading of the world precedes the reading of the word, hence the subsequent reading of the word cannot be done without the continuity of reading the word."  \(FREIRE, P. The importance of the act of reading. 23 ed. São Paulo: Autores Associados: Cortez, 1989. p. 11.\)**‌**
