# Introduction

The initiative to prepare this manual is to guarantee educators and students a broad and detailed understanding of what Sumé and Sumé LMS are and how they can assist in the development and implementation of virtual classes. Both initiatives emerged during the Covid-19 pandemic, motivated by the visible difficulty encountered by educators in adapting face-to-face classes to virtual classes.

Throughout the manual, you will not find solutions to the problems of education, as we do not have this intention. The content we provide aims to help and assist educators to transport the same teaching from the physical classroom to the virtual classroom, trying, in all aspects, not to lose the quality necessary for the transmission of knowledge.

Precisely for this reason, you will notice that our focus on this material is to indicate solutions that help to solve problems and overcome obstacles of everyday life. We will not discuss the types of pedagogical approaches, whether there is a more correct line of thought or not. Our goal is to facilitate learning, regardless of these issues. We want educators to be able to reach their students and for them to be able to follow lessons and learn.

We try to gather in the manual the greatest number of technical and practical orientations aiming to reach the most varied types of educators, regardless of the degree of affinity with the new technologies. Our purpose is that as many educators as possible can take advantage of the information available here, no matter if they only have one cell phone, or if they have an almost professional camera and lighting.

It is also important to make it clear that this manual is not a definitive and closed material. Our intention is for it to be a work under construction, to be developed in a collaborative way both by educators who have the ability to contribute to the subject and by other people who are interested in the quality of education. All new information and suggestions are welcome! Sumé is an innovative project and its success will depend, in large part, on those who are really committed, enthusiastic and use their platform to carry out their school activities. So, enjoy the contents of this manual and have a good class!
